# Movie-Catalog

This is a simple application which makes use of an api that will give us the data to the movies produced.

`API`: [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/)

This is a very interesting api, you can check the documentation of the api if you want to use it.

We are using `Angular` to develop the front end part of the application. To Create the backend Part we are using `NodeJS` + `ExpressJS`.
